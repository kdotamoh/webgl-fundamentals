# WebGL Fundamentals

 WebGL is a rasterization engine that draws points, lines, and triangles based on code you supply

 Because WebGL runs on the GPU it requires vertex and fragment shaders (paired together, they are called a program).


### Vertex shader
Computes and outputs vertex positions that WebGL uses to rasterize primitives (points, lines, or triangles, etc).


### Fragment shader
Computes and outputs a color for each pixel fo the primitive currently being drawn.

### Executing shaders

Most of the WebGL API sets up state for these pairs of functions to run. 

For each thing you want to draw you setup a bunch of state then execute a pair of functions by calling `gl.drawArrays` or `gl.drawElements` which executes your shaders on the GPU.

>WebGL is really just an API to run shaders. The only functions that actually write pixels are gl.clear, gl.drawArrays and gl.drawElements. That's it! All other API calls just setup internal state for when those 3 functions are called.

### Providing data to shaders
1. **Attributes/Buffers**
   
   Arrays of binary data supplied to the GPU. Usually contain (but are not limited to) positions, normals, texture coordinates, vertex colors, etc.

2. **Uniforms**

   Basically global variables.

3. **Textures**
    
    Usually contain image data but can just as easily contain some other data type.

4. **Varyings**

   **Varyings are a way for a vertex shader to pass data to a fragment shader**. Depending on what is being rendered (points/lines/triangles), the values set on a varying by a vertex shader will be interpolated while executing the fragment shader.

### Basics

WebGL only cares about 2 things: clip space coordinates and colors. 
Your 2 "shaders" provide WebGL with those 2 things; 

vertex shader => clip space coordinates,

fragment shader => color.
